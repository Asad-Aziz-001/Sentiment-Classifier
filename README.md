# 💬 EmotionSense — Smart Sentiment Classifier

EmotionSense is a simple yet intelligent **AI-powered web app** that classifies user-entered text as **Positive 😊 or Negative 😞**.  
The project focuses on **clarity, logic, and creativity**, showing how Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be implemented from scratch — **without using any pretrained AI models**.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how text data can be analyzed and classified using a **machine learning model** built entirely from scratch.  
EmotionSense accepts user input through a **beautiful interactive web interface**, processes it using a custom-trained model, and instantly predicts the emotional tone.

The core idea is to show:
- Problem-solving ability in AI.
- Logical thinking in model creation.
- Creative front-end presentation and back-end integration.
